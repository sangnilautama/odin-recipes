    <h2>If you love chicken, why would you smash it?</h2>

    <p>Ayam Penyet (Penyet Chicken) is an incredibly spicy Indonesian dish that will make your tongue feel like
        burning... you will need to go to a special Asian grocery store to get some of the ingredients.</p>

    <p>Penyet is a Javanese term for "squeezed" or "pressed," thus ayam penyet means "squeezed chicken." It is quite
        similar to another popular Indonesian fried chicken dish ayam geprek, as both are fried chicken smashed and
        mixed together with hot and spicy sambal chili paste. The difference is ayam penyet is a traditional Javanese
        ayam goreng half-cooked in bumbu kuning (yellow spice paste) and then deep fried in hot palm oil</p>

    <p>Today Ayam Penyet is commonly found in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore. It has recently surged in
        popularity across Southeast Asia, where various chains of franchises have opened selling the dish along with
        other Indonesian delicacies.</p>
