    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 24-ounce bone-in ribeye steak, 2-inch-thick, at room temperature</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
        <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Using paper towels, pat both sides of the steak dry; season generously with 1 1/4 teaspoons salt and 1/2
            teaspoon pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat a medium cast iron skillet over medium high heat until very hot, about 1-2 minutes; add canola oil.
        </li>
        <li>Place the steak in the middle of the skillet and cook, turning every 2-3 minutes, until a dark crust has
            formed on both sides, about 12-14 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium low. Push steak to one side of the skillet; add butter, garlic, thyme and rosemary to
            opposite side of the skillet, tilting the skillet towards the butter and cooking until butter is foaming,
            about 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Working carefully, spoon butter over steak for 1-2 minutes, turning over once, until it reaches an internal
            temperature of 120 degrees F for medium rare, or until desired doneness. Let rest 15 minutes before slicing.
        </li>
        <li>Serve immediately.</li>
        <ol>
